Height of Binary tree
perfect binary tree number of nodes doubles each level.
so how many nodes do we have in last level.

# of nodes in first level = 1
# of nodes in last level = (n+1)/2

height of tree = # of times we double 1 to get to (n+1)/2 
h= log(n+1)/2

consider when we have only 2 levels ,
 # of times we have to double 1 to get to level2 is 1.

so h = log(n+1)/2 +1
     = log(n+1) - Log(2) +1
     = log(n+1) -1 +1
     = log(n+1)
